## Local Database Setup

We need to setup a local database for our development, the database and GUI we will be using is MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench. These are the links to download the softwares.

### Windows:

- [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-8.3/mysql-8.3.0-winx64.msi)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLGUITools/mysql-workbench-community-8.0.36-winx64.msi)

### Mac:

- [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-8.3/mysql-8.3.0-macos14-arm64.dmg)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLGUITools/mysql-workbench-community-8.0.36-macos-arm64.dmg)

Install the two software in your computer and make sure you added a password in your MySQL Server installation, that password is for your MySQL.

Open the MySQL Workbench. Then, click the add button.

Add connection name to your new connection, put "Local" in it and click the Store in Keychain button below.

By clicking the button, it will show a new window to input the password that you put in when you are installing the MySQL Server.

We need to add two database, "es-db-dev" and "es-db-shadow", this is required by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database).

Click the plus icon in the upper left part of MySQL Workbench. Add a "Schema Name" which is the database name. After you finish adding a name, just click the Apply button on the bottom right of the tab beside Revert button. You need to do it 2x for the two database.

After adding the two database, open your .env file in the project root folder and add these two variables.

```
// NOTE: Only copy the 2 variables below
// Please note that you may have those two variables in your .env file, if you have, please rewrite those with these two.
// Please change the words "password" below with the password that you put in when you are installing the MySQL Server

DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/es-db-dev
SHADOW_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/es-db-shadow
```

After adding those two variables in your .env file, run this command in your terminal under project root folder.

`npx prisma db push`

In order to verify if the setup is correct, go to your MySQL Workbench and open es-db-dev database Tables and check there are existing tables.

If there are tables, you are good to go. If you don't see any, please contact John or Ramil.
